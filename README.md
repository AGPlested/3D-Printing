3D Printable objects used for microscopy and beyond in the Plested lab, Humboldt University and FMP Berlin

Mounts for Princeton Instruments ProEM512 (KP ProEM mount 0.2) and Photometrics Prime95B (KP Prime95B mount 0.2) cameras are included. These cameras have imperial threaded mounting points. The mounts allow the camera to be mounted directly to a M6 tapped 25 mm pitch breadboard, or to standard M6 tapped posts. You will need 8x32 (PI) or 1/4x20 (Photometrics) imperial screws to attach the cameras to mounts. 

On a standard Prusa 3D mk3 printer, KP Prime95B mount 0.2 takes about 12 hours to print, and uses about 3â‚¬ of PLA. We use standard settings: 15% fill-in, no supports, 0.15mm layers - in other words, the 'QUALITY MK3' setting. 

The coverslip holder (KP CSH 0.2) is meant to accept 25 mm 1.5H glass coverslips, for example for STORM or TIRF microscopy. We print this with the 0.05mm ULTRADETAIL setting. 

* .scad files are for generating models in openSCAD: https://www.openscad.org
* .stl files are for generating 3D models to print. For example, with Slic3r: https://slic3r.org
